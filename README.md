Gotta catch em' all! Retro style pok√© ball opening animation with a really ugly Jigglypuff.
I should probably change the Jigglypuff but for now you get the point.

In order to create this animation I imported the dudraw python package documentation - https://kwertyops.github.io/dudraw/index.html

Hope you enjoy! Feel free to use for inspo, good luck.
